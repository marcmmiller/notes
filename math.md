How Did Archimedes Do It?
===================


How did Archimedes discover the value of $\pi$ without using trigonometry or
calculus or analytic geometry?  How did he do it using only the relatively blunt
mathematical tools available to him?  Namely the Pythagorean Theorem and
Euclidean Geometry.

Archimedes knew from studying other shapes that the circumference of a circle
grows in linear porportion to its diameter.  


Consider this diagram.

Let us first show that $\triangle{COM}\approx\triangle{CMD}$.
